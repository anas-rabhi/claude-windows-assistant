# Claude Windows Assistant

This is an interactive command line Windows assistant powered by Claude 3.5. The work is heavily inspired by [claude-engineer (Doriandarko)](https://github.com/Doriandarko/claude-engineer/) (thank you ðŸ˜€). The main difference is that this assistant has only two tools: one tool allows writing and executing Python code to perform any task on the computer, and the second tool is an LLM. I have been using Claude 3.5 for a while now, and the quality of its code is very advanced. That's why I thought that giving Claude full control of a Windows computer could be very powerful... or risky ðŸ˜…

This repo is in an early stage, and I am still experimenting. I am using Claude 3.5 sonnet through the Bedrock API for now.
